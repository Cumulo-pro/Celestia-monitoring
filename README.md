 - Setup Guides: Instructions for using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor consensus and validator nodes.
 - Metrics Documentation: Details on key metrics available in Grafana.
 - Custom Metrics: Tutorials for setting up Node Exporter to collect bridge node metrics.
 - Blobstream Monitoring: Tools for monitoring Blobstream Orchestrator service, including error detection and alerts via Telegram.
