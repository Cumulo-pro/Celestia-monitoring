# Blobstream Orchestrator Monitor
## Introduction
Blobstream is a data availability solution designed for Ethereum that scales securely with the number of users. Formerly known as the Quantum Gravity Bridge (QGB), Blobstream relays commitments to Celestia's data root to an on-chain light client on Ethereum, enabling developers to integrate it into Layer 2 (L2) contracts. 
This allows Ethereum developers to build high-throughput L2s using advanced data availability mechanisms while still benefiting from the security guarantees of the Ethereum mainnet.
