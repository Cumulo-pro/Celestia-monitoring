# Celestia Consensus & Validator Node Metrics

In this section of the Celestia-monitoring project, we focus on monitoring and analyzing metrics related to the consensus and validator nodes of the Celestia blockchain. We provide detailed guides and resources necessary to set up and use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the performance and status of the nodes.

## Available Resources

1. **[Monitoring a Celestia consensus node with Grafana and Prometheus](https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/Celestia-monitoring/blob/main/grafana_consensus%20/Grafana%26Prometheus.md)**

   This is a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up monitoring for a consensus node and validator for the Celestia blockchain using Prometheus and Grafana. The document covers everything from initial installation steps to final adjustments to have a fully functional monitoring system.

2. **[Grafana consensus & validator metrics](https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/Celestia-monitoring/blob/main/grafana_consensus%20/grafana_consensus_metrics.md)**

   This document details the specific metrics available in Grafana for Celestia's consensus and validator nodes. It includes descriptions and explanations of various key metrics, such as sync status, validator voting power, mempool size, and more.

With these resources, you will be able to set up a robust monitoring platform that allows you to maintain detailed control over the performance and health of the Celestia nodes in your network.
