This section of the Celestia-monitoring project is dedicated to tracking and analyzing metrics for the Celestia blockchain's consensus and validator nodes. It provides comprehensive guides and resources for setting up and using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to effectively monitor the performance and status of these nodes.

## Available Resources

- **[Monitoring a Celestia consensus node with Grafana and Prometheus](https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/Celestia-monitoring/blob/main/grafana_consensus%20/Grafana%26Prometheus.md)**

   This is a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up monitoring for a consensus node and validator for the Celestia blockchain using Prometheus and Grafana. The document covers everything from initial installation steps to final adjustments to have a fully functional monitoring system.

- **[Grafana consensus & validator metrics](https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/Celestia-monitoring/blob/main/grafana_consensus%20/grafana_consensus_metrics.md)**

   This document details the specific metrics available in Grafana for Celestia's consensus and validator nodes. It includes descriptions and explanations of various key metrics, such as sync status, validator voting power, mempool size, and more.

- **[Celestia Consensus & Validator Node](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21116-celestia-consensus-validator-node/)**

   This Grafana dashboard provides a comprehensive and detailed view of the state and activity of nodes within the Celestia consensus system, allowing network administrators and developers to monitor various critical aspects of the infrastructure in real time. 

With these resources, you will be able to set up a robust monitoring platform that allows you to maintain detailed control over the performance and health of the Celestia nodes in your network.
